## Services

### Contract Packing & White Label

Whether it’s your own formula or one you need help developing, we take care of blending, filling, and labelling for natural, cosmetic, wellness, or botanical products. From trial batches to large scale runs, we adapt to your needs.

### Formulation & Blending

Using natural or botanical ingredients, we blend oils, powders, creams, and serums. We can work with your existing formula or help you refine a new recipe.

### Packaging Solutions

Bottles, jars, sprays, pouches, tubes — including eco-friendly materials. We can also source packaging and/or customise labelling to reflect your brand identity.

### Small Batch Options

No need to commit to big production volumes right away. We offer small batch processing so you can test the market, refine your designs or packaging.
